# Project 1
I wrote a script for project 1 that displays some basic information about the system.

## What it does
This script will display the following information about the system:
* CPU
* Total Memory
* OS Platform
* Current User

## How to run
You will need to install NodeJS from [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en).  Afterward you should be able to run the command below in the directory that the script was placed in.
```bash
node sysinfo
```
