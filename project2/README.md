# Project 2
I wrote a script for project 2 that reads text from a file and hosts it on a web server
## What is does
The script will take an argument of a file path and then display the content from that file on a web server
## How to run
You will need to install NodeJS from [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en).  Afterward you should be able to run the command below in the directory that the script was placed in.
```bash
node hostFile.js --filePath ""
```
Make sure to replace the name of the file you would like to display inside of the double quotes
